				<p>Hello! My name is John Moran. I am curreently 22 years old and working towards my Bachelors of Business Administration degree at Western Michigan University With a major in Computer Information Systems. I like to think of myself as a prospective junior developer who is always searching for new things to learn. I have always had a love of technology and working with people. This brought me into the IT field and ever since then I have pushed myself to become better and better at what I do.. I have an extensive background in the world of IT. I have worked as a computer repair technician, a Level-2 Helpdesk technician, and a Field Technician just to name a few of the roles I've held. My focus over the last year has been to increase my knowledge of the web programming world. I first began my programming journey in high school with a couple of introduction to C++ courses and my love of programming began. From there I moved on to wanting to create my own web pages and build web applications. I have been trudging my way through learning all of the basics to build a solid footing in HTML, CSS, and especially Javascript. I am always hungry to learn more and I work hard to learn about the things that interest me. This site is an extension of what I have learned and will be my canvas for displaying all that I have learned.</p><br>

				<p>Outside of work and to take a break from technology I have myriad other interests including, but not limited to:</p><br>

				<ul>
					<li>Sports and Athletics
						<ul>
							<li>Football</li>
							<li>Weight Lifting</li>
							<li>Swimming</li>
							<li>Running</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br>
					<li>Reading - Favorite genres and mediums include:
						<ul>
							<li>Science Fiction</li>
							<li>Fantasy</li>
							<li>Historical Fiction</li>
							<li>Manga</li>
							<li>Graphic Novels</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
