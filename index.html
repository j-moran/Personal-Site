	<div id="intro">
		<p>Hello! My name is John Moran. I am a prospective junior developer who is always searching for new things to learn. I have an extensive background in the world of IT. I have worked as a computer repair technician, a Level-2 Helpdesk technician, and a Field Technician just to name a few of the roles I've held. My focus over the last year has been to increase my knowledge of the web programming world. I first began my programming journey in high school with a couple of introduction to C++ courses and my love of programming began. From there I moved on to wanting to create my own web pages and build web applications. I have been trudging my way through learning all of the basics to build a solid footing in HTML, CSS, and especially Javascript. I am always hungry to learn more and I work hard to learn about the things that interest me. This site is an extension of what I have learned and will be my canvas for displaying all that I have learned.</p>
